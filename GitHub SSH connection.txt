Step 1 :- Check if you've existing ssh keys. 
    $ ls ~/.ssh
If you already have existing key then you need to create a new set of public and private keys.
    $ ssh-key -t ed25519 -C "youremail@email.com"    
    Please use your correct email. Command should show you the message like this "Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (C:\Users\UserName/.ssh/id_ed25519):" 

Enter here your keys file name like : id_rsa_github2
Next prompt will be for passphrase, please enter a passphrase. And it should show you the something like :- 
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|        .  .==&=+|
|       .    o+o=.|
|      o      oo  |
|     o .S . o E  |
|    o   .. . =   |
|   .     o  . .  |
|        . .  o   |
|           ..    |
+----[SHA256]-----+

Step 2:- If you use "ls ~/.ssh" command new two files with the names id_rsa_github2 should be there. Open "id_rsa_github2.pub" file and copy the ssh key.

Step 3:- Open your GitHub account and go to settings -> SSH-Keys and click on New SSH Key. Paste the copied ssh key in step 2 here and save.

Step 4:- Run following command on your terminal.
    $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github2

Step 5:- Test your connection to GitHub with following command.
    $ ssh -T git@github.com

It might result something like this :- 
Warning: Permanently added the ECDSA host key for IP address '140.82.121.4' to the list of known hosts.
Enter passphrase for key 'C:\Users\UserName/.ssh/id_rsa_github':
Hi User! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.


Step 6:- Clone your repository again with the ssh git clone path.
    $ git clone https://github.com/User/example.git
